      I think this is the only reference to days changing length in canon at
      all, but Twilight does say that Nightmare Moon will return on the
      longest day of the thousandth year and identifies this date as the day
      of the Summer Sun Celebration.

      Since Twilight Sparkle and Spike relocate to Ponyville in this episode,
      every other episode featuring them within Ponyville must follow. This
      leaves precious few episodes that could have possibly occurred prior to
      this point, but some do exist, depending on how much stretching you wish
      to accommodate.

      While fighting Nightmare Moon, Twilight teleports at most 15 meters,
      which leaves her winded. This is an indirect gauge of the growth of her
      magical skill.

      Twilight and Spike seem to know the others fairly well by this stage.

      At the conclusion of the chase scene, Twilight teleports what has to be
      at least a few hundred meters, directly into the library, and it leaves
      her winded and produces an unintended side effect, which is an indirect
      gauge of the growth of her magical skill.

      Since this is the episode that introduces the Grand Galloping Gala as a
      future event, it must precede the Gala itself, and Suited for Success,
      in which the gala dresses would appear first chronologically.

      There is no way Rarity would dream of having an audience with Celestia
      after having been invited to stay at the castle during Sweet and Elite,
      so that episode has to follow, unfortunately. *(It would make untangling
      Rarity and Blueblood a bit easier if it didn't.)*

      When Fluttershy comments that she is doing "spring cleaning" for
      Twilight, Twilight rebukes her saying that it's summer and locking the
      season for this episode. There is no way it can be any other summer than
      the first.

      Applebuck season is the day all apples get bucked off the trees. Since
      it's a "season," there's the implication that it's the last time in the
      year this happens, even if multiple harvests are collected per year.

      Furthermore, Fluttershy is busy with the bunny census. Bunnies, at least
      in our world, mate seasonally from February to October, subject to
      weather and resource availability, and it would be rather silly to start
      doing that before they *stop,* seeing as how a single female can produce
      up to about 84 offspring a year, and environmental changes late in the
      mating period can wildly skew the result. This further settles the
      position of this episode as one of the last episodes of an autumn. Due
      to the general level of familiarity between the Mane 6 shown, I think we
      have to keep it within the first autumn.

      Twilight teleports about 20 meters when there really wasn't any need to
      do this, and repeatedly teleports in quick succession with no sign of
      being tired by this.

      There's a fan theory that the injury Big Mac sports in this episode is
      due to the bet that Applejack mentions in [Ticket Master,](#ep-1x03)
      regarding hauling apples around and having to walk down the street in a
      girdle, and if that is true, Ticket Master has to immediately precede
      this episode. Later episodes seem to suggest Big Mac is sufficiently
      secure in his masculinity to actually do that, though, and Ticket Master
      is season locked to summer.

      Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie don't know each other very well -- Rainbow
      doesn't know Pinkie is a prankster and spent most of the morning
      unsuccessfully avoiding her, which ends with "You know Pinkie Pie,
      you're not as annoying as I thought."

      Rainbow Dash refers to her friends as being "new." It could be argued
      that they're new compared to Gilda, but even then it sounds like they're
      new to Rainbow herself.

      Celestia's room has a burning fireplace for some unclear reason, with
      actual logs and a flame in it, suggesting it's *not* summer, however, or
      at least, an unusually cool day in Canterlot.

      The Mane 5 appear not to know that much about each other or Twilight,
      which makes it obvious this should be somewhere within the first ten
      episodes, but that in itself is not a hard lock.

      Importantly, this episode introduces Mane 5 to the fact that Twilight is
      a prodigy. Every episode in which Twilight performs spectacular magic
      beyond average has to follow this, up until Magical Mystery Cure. I
      believe that Sonic Rainboom, A Dog and Pony Show, Swarm of the Century,
      The Return of Harmony, Lesson Zero, The Mysterious Mare Do Well, It's
      About Time, A Canterlot Wedding, The Crystal Empire and Too Many Pinkie
      Pies qualify, and others that do qualify have one of these as a
      prerequisite. Obviously, it can't happen after Magic Duel.

      This episode introduces Trixie and is explicitly referred to as her
      first appearance since then.

      This is the only episode featuring Angel Bunny's personal dwelling, and
      in all subsequent episodes featuring Fluttershy's cottage, Angel lives
      inside Fluttershy's cottage itself, there's no trace of his ~~dog~~
      rabbithouse. The only reasonable interpretation is that he moved in soon
      afterwards, and his house was disassembled, which means that every other
      episode featuring an outside view of Fluttershy's cottage has to follow
      this one. All of these are listed, except those that occur after the
      Twilicorn landmark, since those would be redundant constraints.

      Episodes that feature the cottage but do not actually give a clear view
      of the front are likewise not constrained by this one -- that includes
      [May The Best Pet Win](#ep-2x07).

      Since it is unlikely that Angel Bunny was close enough to Fluttershy to
      hang out with her all the time until he moved in, this also *should,*
      but not necessarily *does* happen before the Ticket Master, where he
      briefly steals the tickets for her and accompanies her on the
      butter-up-to-Twilight mission.

      Applejack and Rarity don't know each other particularly well, and the
      experience of spending an extended period of time together is clearly
      new to them.

      While the storm *would* normally imply autumn, summer rains are more
      likely to actually be storms, rather than constant drizzles, at least
      with weather reasonably approximating anything ecologically
      sound. Applejack's statement is that *"They accidentally skipped a
      scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make
      up for it, is all."* can be interpreted as "Someone told Applejack that
      this was accidental" -- when in fact, for a celebration like the Summer
      Sun Celebration, you *would* skip a scheduled drizzle.

      Scheduling a drizzle for a national holiday and then *forgetting* about
      it entirely, so that it needs to be made up for the following week,
      sounds like exactly the sort of thing Rainbow Dash would do, which is
      why I'm putting this episode very early on.

      This episode explicitly introduces Zecora. Nobody is friends with her,
      and beside Twilight, nobody even knows zebras exist.

      Rainbow says "Well, *that's* interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic
      Pants herself." That implies the magnitude of Twilight's skill is magic
      is already known, which suggests that Boast Busters has already
      happened, but does not make it definite.

      Zecora comes to town "once a month," resulting in the shutdown of most
      of the businesses in town. Even assuming Twilight could miss one or two
      visits, it's extremely unlikely she could miss them for the entire
      summer, so this episode has to precede the beginning of the first year's
      autumn.

      The CMC have yet to form, since Apple Bloom never tries to involve her
      friends in the events.

      Zecora reappears.

      While Twilight's statement "Nopony can herd like Applejack" can be
      interpreted as a reference to Applebuck Season, this is not definite, as
      Twilight could have observed Applejack in action at a different time.

      The episode ends with major damage to Ponyville, and requires a certain
      time for repairs.

      Wrapping up winter requires this episode to conclude a winter.

      Since it is also explicitly Twilight's first winter in Ponyville, the
      position of this episode on the timeline is hard-locked relative to
      [Friendship is Magic](#ep-1x01-02) -- it must be immediately followed by
      the beginning of the [first spring of the first year](#ep-SM1-SP) of the
      series.

      This episode requires some crafty interpretation, that is reflected in
      the constraints presented. If you substantially disagree with this
      interpretation, you run into a dependency loop problem anyway.

      * It is important for the plot of this and subsequent CMC episodes that
        this is the first time they meet closely enough to get
        introduced. While they do cower together during Friendship is Magic,
        this does not, strictly speaking, require them to learn each other's
        names, or even remember much details.
      * In subsequent CMC episodes, the class composition differs from the one
        seen here, requiring something to happen to change it. But the new
        composition includes both Diamond Tiara, Silver Spoon *and* the CMC.
      * The entire episode occupies no more than a week's time, since at the
        beginning, Diamond Tiara issues an open invitation to a party that is
        to happen "this weekend."
      * Twilight is present in the middle of that week, and Apple Bloom
        addresses her like she has known her for a substantial time.

      This also the time period during which Twist gets her cutie mark, and
      Diamond Tiara received hers no more than a week prior to the start of
      this episode, but that's beside the point.

      The problem with the whole thing is that so far, all evidence remains
      consistent with school year starting in autumn, just like ours --
      whatever it is, the CMC get large stretches of time where they are left
      almost entirely unsupervised, and they're all set in greener
      seasons. Accepting this, however, produces a dependency loop, since this
      episode would have to be the *last* episode of a school year for the
      class to get rearranged, which is impossible due to Twilight's presence,
      while putting it in the first autumn of the series causes a conflict
      between [Sisterhooves Social](#ep-2x05) and [Made in
      Manehattan](#ep-5x16-17), which are in a rigid temporal relationship.

      The best way out of this I can see so far is to posit that what we're
      seeing on screen here is a *remedial* class in summer. This has the
      following results:

      * This permits this episode to happen in the first summer of the series,
        before autumn rolls in, and resolve the dependency loop without
        leaving us with a completely unknown school year schedule.
      * Whatever combination of foals and fillies we see on screen is
        temporary, and a new class will start in autumn, which will include
        both CMC and DT/SS.
      * This would explain also why a class is studying something so
        fundamentally basic in the first place, even though most of the
        children in it already have cutie marks.

      Some snags remain:

      * It is odd that Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are in a remedial class,
        while Snips and Snails aren't. This can be explained by the girls
        having had an unspecified rich girl engagement that prevented them
        from attending school. They are, notably, the only ones who *complain*
        about the subject of the lecture. Snips and Snails, however, might
        turn out to be smarter than they appear. See also [Buckball
        Season](#ep-6x18).
      * It reflects rather poorly on Cherilee's otherwise celebrated teaching
        skill. That can be explained by most of the ponies in the remedial
        class being children of recently arrived families, and thus outside of
        Cherilee's fault.

      The running of the leaves ritual places this at the very end of an
      autumn. In [Tanks for the Memories,](#ep-5x05) we can observe the winter
      startup procedures, and if that episode is in any way typical, snow
      starts almost the very next day after the running of the leaves
      concludes.

      The start of the first year's autumn is obviously a hard constraint on
      this episode. As far as we can tell, this *is* Twilight's first autumn
      in Ponyville, though it does not necessarily have to be, which means a
      soft constraint against the start of the first winter.

      Spike is absent, despite one scene happening in the library. This could
      take place a week after [Look Before You Sleep,](#ep-1x08) as we are
      told in that episode that Spike is in Canterlot.

      In The Ticket Master, Rainbow Dash said she hadn't perfected her
      signature move for the Wonderbolts, which should, in theory, refer to
      the Sonic Rainboom. However, she never lists Sonic Rainboom among the

      The CMC are in the early stages of figuring out what they have to do to
      get their cutie marks, and there's clearly no clubhouse yet.

      Twilight mentions going to Zecora for tea, but never reaches her.

      Rarity references the Stare in the beginning of the episode explicitly,
      so unless Rarity was aware of the Stare in some other way this has to
      happen after Dragonshy.

      This episode introduces the CMC clubhouse, and appears to be spread over
      multiple weeks -- which, in case it happens during the school year, have
      to become months. As such, it probably happens in parallel with multiple
      other episodes.

      Many of the activities they engaged in during the multiple montages had
      to have involved considerable fallout and cleanup, which would take
      time, and preparation for the talent show had to have occupied them for
      weeks.

      Notably, the CMC don't tease each other like they do in the [Stare

      Rarity is less famous than Fluttershy gets in one day, Photo Finish
      basically ignores her, and nobody recognizes her. But we also see the
      dresses that Rarity made in Suited For Success, so more likely than not,
      Hoity Toity just didn't have the time to drum up a market yet.

      Notably, in [A Dog and Pony Show](#ep-1x19) Sapphire Shores mentions the
      "Clothes Horse" magazine writing rave reviews, and the only incident
      that could conceivably lead to that in the timeframe available is Hoity
      Toity's visit. This permits Green Isn't Your Color to exist in the gap
      between that visit and the time the next issue of the magazine came
      out. In our world, monthly glossy magazines are typically sent off to
      the printers at least two weeks before their official release date, with
      all the articles finalized, which makes this gap at least two weeks and
      at most six weeks wide.

      This is said to take place immediately before the first apple
      harvest.

      Appleloosa is generally more desert-y than Ponyville, so it's probable
      they're limited to one harvest per year, at least at this point, in
      which case this episode occurs in autumn of the first year, presumably,
      right before Applebuck Season. However, this is not a hard limit, and
      the episode can also occur in summer or spring.

      We see Rarity's Gala dress in this episode, so this must be after
      Suited For Success.

      Celestia makes an actual visit to Ponyville, exactly the kind of visit
      that did not happen in [Swarm of the Century](#ep-1x10), strongly
      suggesting that the latter has to have happened by now.

      The CMC are more independent. But they ask the Mane 6 how they got their
      cutie marks and the actual practice of crusading is not yet

      Since Owlowiscious is essentially invisible most of the time, his
      introduction could have occurred at more or less any point. But, since
      the CMC don't seem to know each other too well, and in fact don't
      interact with anyone other than their own Mane 6 members at all, this
      should take place in the first autumn of the series, or at least before
      the first winter. This is further supported by Twilight saying "Gosh,
      it's cold tonight." -- a summer in Equestria shouldn't have cold nights,
      should it?

      In [A Dog And Pony Show](#ep-1x19) Spike, apparently, loses the unique
      red cart that he is seen using here -- because he never gets an
      opportunity to bring it back, and when the Mane 6 go home, loaded with
      looted gems, he does not have it. If that is accepted as a chronology
      marker, it provides an upper bound on this episode.

      Pinkie's birthday occurs during this episode.

      Either Pinkie does not trust her new friends *yet,* or her unusual
      behavior in this episode is an aftereffect of Discord's influence, which
      packages this episode next to other similar incidents like [Putting Your
      Hoof Down](#ep-2x19) and [Somepony To Watch Over Me](#ep-4x17) -- and
      possibly, [Lesson Zero](#ep-2x03) itself, which is a constraint on
      Putting Your Hoof Down.

      Since Twilight knows Gummy, it must follow Feeling Pinkie Keen. No more
      than a year can pass between this and Feeling Pinkie Keen, since Gummy
      is turning one year old. This makes it ridiculously difficult, though
      not impossible, for this episode to occur in any spring other than the
      spring of the first year.

      Spike refers to this being a spring day explicitly, and Rarity refers to
      a "Spring has sprung" party Pinkie hosted previously sometime in recent
      memory, which locks it against the beginning of the first year's spring.

      The Gala dresses can be observed in the Boutique, requiring this episode
      to follow their introduction.

      According to Spike's line in Ticket Master, the Gala is held on the
      21th of a certain month. If he only told us which one!

      The Gala seems like the kind of event you need a lot of time to prepare
      for, so it would be quite a while alter Ticket Master and Suited For
      Success.

      In Ticket Master, Fluttershy mentions that for the night of the Gala and
      that night only, all the flowers in the gardens bloom, and speaks of it
      as if it were a natural event. This can't happen in autumn or winter, so
      it has to be spring or summer. In Suited for Success, Rarity describes
      Fluttershy's dress as "it just sings spring," further suggesting that
      the Gala has to occur during a spring month. Since we have some rather
      strong season locks, there's a default sort lock against the beginning
      of first year's spring.

      The CMC tease each other and come to blows -- they never did anything of
      the sort since Stare Master, suggesting that it's still relatively early
      in their friendship, but that is a matter of interpretation.

      Friendship reports from Over a Barrel, A Dog and Pony Show, Cutie Mark
      Chronicles, and Bridle Gossip are cited, flashbacks from Applebuck
      Season, Friendship is Magic, Winter Wrap-Up and Fall Weather Friends are

      Twilight Sparkle and Spike have been in Ponyville tor a while, and the
      Mane 5 are upset at the idea that Twilight could be taken away. They
      also appear to know the princess quite well by now, indicating that [A
      Bird In The Hoof](#ep-1x22) is probably in the past. The CMC are playing
      together, so this at least follows Call of the Cutie, but they also
      tease each other in a manner more consistent with their behavior in
      [Stare Master](#ep-1x17) and [The Return of
      Harmony](#ep-2x01-02). Twilight teleports casually throughout the entire
      second half of this episode.

      At the same time, placing this episode close to its airing order
      requires reinterpreting many other episodes which contain communications
      from the Mane 6 to Celestia as retrospective to satisfy other
      constraints.

      My current best theory is that Lesson Zero and a few other episodes are
      part of a package immediately following The Return of Harmony.

      * Discord is stone again, but he made the Mane Six doubt their own
      virtues, and while they did beat him, some of the doubt is
      lingering. Which is what he was aiming for, he got the last laugh from
      the statue garden. Twilight is upset that she needed bailing out by way
      of returned letters, which grows into a feeling of her own inadequacy,
      this week is the worst time ever for her to be tardy... and Lesson Zero
      happens.
      * The town bounces back from it in minutes, but it's a bit heavier on
      the Mane Six. Pinkie even uses an excuse -- Gummy's party feels like one,
      she likes her alligator, but I'm not sure the alligator likes everypony
      else enough to be pleased by them attending his birthday -- to cheer her
      friends up. It works, but it's not enough for Pinkie. She is worried
      that her friends actually are laughing at her instead of with her -- and
      as a result tries to have another [Party of One](#ep-1x25) immediately
      afterwards, and gets her suspicions inadvertently confirmed, because it
      so happened that this coincided with her own birthday. Which she
      completely forgot about while worrying.
      * Applejack has never worried much about herself. But she has always
      worried about her family, and feels inadequate about being able to
      protect them. Now that business necessitates she leave Apple Bloom alone
      for a time, she just can't stop coming back and being overprotective and
      overbearing. [Somepony to Watch Over Me](#ep-4x17) happens. She is very
      busy with that and the actual trip.
      * Which is why Applejack is completely missing while Fluttershy is
      [Putting Your Hoof Down](#ep-2x19) in her own fit of feeling
      inadequate. Meanwhile, Ponyville is suffering from an unscheduled
      tourist invasion due to the rumor spreading that it was the chaos
      capital of the world for a day, getting the marketplace to hike prices
      up.
      * Celestia alone knows what exactly Rainbow is doing at the time, but my
      guess is, she is out visiting her family in Cloudsdale, remembering what
      Discord got *her* with.
      * Rarity's too much of a lady or too certain of her fabulousness to let
      it show, and Tom the boulder was shame enough. :)

      That permits us to package four episodes into a thematically cohesive
      unit occupuing two weeks at the longest.

      Sweetie Belle wouldn't have known Applebloom until Call of the Cutie, so
      this must occur afterwards.

      A rack containing all the Gala dresses is present in the Boutique,
      requiring this episode to occur after their creation.

      This episode contains a friendship report by Rarity and Sweetie Belle,
      which should set it after Lesson Zero -- however, the montage during the
      report suggests at least a week passed between the Social and the
      writing of the report itself, and it is possible for it to refer to
      entirely backdated events.

      An integer number of years must pass between this and [Brootherhooves

      Owlowiscious reappears, and this episode introduces Tank.

      This episode must occur after spring of Year 1 rolls in, because Rainbow
      first observes Tank hibernating in Tanks for the Memories. It also makes
      it impossible for more than a full year to pass between these two
      episodes, and much more likely, slightly more than half.

      One of Rainbow's pictures with potential pets depicts her in a
      book-related situation, which, before [Read it And Weep,](#ep-2x16)
      could be considered uncool. Rainbow ends the episode with an explicit

      In the cold open, the Rainbow Dash fan club meeting is held in the CMC
      clubhouse, which was constructed in Show Stoppers.

      During this episode, the dam that is also seen in [It's About
      Time](#ep-2x20) breaks. In that latter episode, the crack -- apparently,
      the same crack -- is patched up preventively, however. It is possible,
      though unorthodox, for The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well to actually occupy
      the same stretch of timeline, and be written out of existence due to
      Twilight disaster-proofing the entire immediate region and preventing
      Rainbow Dash from ever motivating the Mare Do Well to exist. *(The
      perpetuation of this into a stable time loop, however, would be entirely
      Twilight's fault.)*

      As a result of this episode, a letter to Celestia happens, setting this
      after Lesson Zero.

      Twilight's birthday occurs during this episode.

      Rarity is caught in her Gala dress, which means that both Suited for
      Success and Green Isn't Your Color, which can only happen after Suited
      for Success, and needs to have happened immediately afterwards, must
      have occurred prior.

      At the same time it needs to be before [The Best Night Ever,](#ep-1x26)
      because Twilight thinks Rarity is going to sell dresses for the Gala and
      refers to the Gala as "coming up." I don't think it's the *next* year's
      Gala, which, as far as we can tell, is depicted in [Make New Friends but
      Keep Discord](#ep-5x07). Fancy Pants is introduced to Rarity in this
      episode, so every time they are shown to interact must happen
      afterwards, and that would include the Canterlot Wedding.

      Nevertheless, neither Gala is a hard bound on the positioning of this
      episode.

      Of particular interest is Rarity's interaction with Prince Blueblood
      which occurs in this episode, because its interpretation may introduce
      different soft constraints on positioning this episode relative to [The
      Ticket Master](#ep-1x03) and The Best Night Ever.

      Rarity is shown writing a Lesson Zero-pattern letter to Celestia
      herself, *and then* Celestia walks in on her. If anything, this makes it
      clear to me, that these letters *may* be written ahead of time -- Rarity
      starts writing it before she even leaves Canterlot, she wouldn't be
      sending it from Canterlot as well! -- and *may* refer to events other
      than current. In fact, it makes me think that the Mane 6 have an
      arrangement to keep Celestia placated by advance-scheduling their
      letters regarding what could also be past incidents.

      At the same time, this *particular* episode unambiguously has Lesson
      Zero as the hard lower constraint.

      Spike mentions it's his first birthday in Ponyville, so less than a year
      has to have passed before he first arrived to Ponyville in Friendship is
      Magic. This makes it impossible for the episode to occur after the start
      of the autumn of year 2, and very unlikely for it to occur after the
      start of the summer of year 2 -- a certain gap is possible depending on
      how much summer was already out by the time Twilight arrived to
      Ponyville.

      Since the only date that we are aware of that Spike can count as his
      birthday at all is the day of hatching, it probably has to be on an
      annual boundary with the day of school entrance examinations for the
      School for Gifted Unicorns, but we can't lock that one down even if we
      bring the comics in. Logically, it should be either spring or early
      summer, and it has to have happened before the next Summer Sun
      Celebration, which redundantly hard locks this episode to precede
      Princess Twilight Sparkle.

      There is a possibility that this is the date when his egg was *laid*
      instead, but nobody has ever given any indication of knowing when the
      egg was laid or where it came from at all, and Twilight disclaimed all
      knowledge explicitly in Dragon Quest. We can assume Celestia knows, but
      she never told anyone that we know of. If she somehow did, that could be
      the day Spike considers his birthday, which would allow to push this
      episode earlier.

      Due to the large amount of destruction Spike inflicted, this episode
      implies a certain gap afterwards required to rebuild Ponyville. Notably,
      the destruction pattern observed in the restoration work seen during The
      Last Roundup appears to be closer to the one Spike inflicted here,
      rather than to the effects of the Swarm of the Century.

      The CMC appear and Scootaloo sports a scooter, which gives us [The Show
      Stoppers](#ep-1x18) as a soft lower bound and Call of the Cutie as the
      hard lower bound. Lesson Zero is another, because Spike ends the episode
      with an explicit letter to Celestia.

      Being a holiday similar to Christmas, Hearth's Warming Eve *should*
      occur around the same time, in theory. It also cannot possibly occur
      before the start of the first year's winter, and unless there's a
      missing year between Magical Mystery Cure and the beginning of the
      second year's summer, has to happen during the first year's winter,
      since Twilight does not yet have wings.

      This holiday is apparently the only noteworthy event that happens in
      Ponyville in winter. For the rest of it, ponies have got to be either
      hibernating or shopping.

      The CMC are at school during this episode. so this probably isn't

      clubhouse, so it must be after Show Stoppers.

      Notice that timber volves appear to only come close enough to Ponyville

      The Cake Twins are newly born in the opening scenes, but most of the
      episode occurs a month after that. For the purposes of this chronology
      "the time of this episode" is the time of the sequence when Pinkie is
      babysitting the Cake twins.

      Inside the sequence, Twilight refers to a report to Princess Celestia
      summarizing all her other reports, but this can have happened both
      before and after [Lesson Zero.](#ep-2x03) At the end of the episode,
      however, Pinkie narrates a Lesson Zero pattern letter to Celestia, but

      This does contradict Amy Keating Rogers' rebuttal regarding Derpy, but
      eh, I think that's her problem.

      Applejack narrates a report to Princess Celestia, which implies the
      events of episode occur after [Lesson Zero](#ep-2x03), but she does not
      refer to them as having happened today or recently, and is not observed
      writing the letter, so this does not produce a hard bound.

      The trees still have apples, so we can assume that it's before Applebuck
      Season. Spike says it's not long until Sapphire Season, which *might* be
      the period described in in [A Dog And Pony Show,](#ep-1x19) when he and
      Rarity are looking for gems.

      While Applejack narrates a report to Princess Celestia at the end of the
      episode, she is not shown writing or sending it and it is not referred
      to inside the episode otherwise, making [Lesson Zero](#ep-2x03) a soft

      Rainbow Dash's statement that reading is undeniably, unquestionably
      uncool precludes any scene where Rainbow reads from happening before
      this episode.

      As a result of the events of this episode, a letter to Princess Celestia
      is written, making Lesson Zero a hard lower bound.

      Hearts and Hooves Day is analogous to Valentine's day, but the scenes

      spring. The school is in session, as well. This is a difficult one to

      There was a theory for this episode that placed it before the beginning
      of the series. However, in that case it would have to feature Angel
      Bunny's home, which it does not, Angel lives with Fluttershy inside her
      cottage already. We're only left with my own theory:

      It should happen immediately after [The Return of Harmony,](#ep-2x01-02)
      (next to [Somepony to Watch Over Me](#ep-4x17) which shows a similarly
      crazy behavior by Applejack and possibly, [Party of One,](#ep-1x25) not
      to mention [Lesson Zero](#ep-2x03) itself) based on the idea that
      Fluttershy's exceeding submissiveness is the aftereffect of Discord's
      influence. Lesson Zero is not a hard bound, however, since Fluttershy
      narrates the letter, but is not shown writing or sending it.

      This episode has very few hard constraints, and an exhaustive search was
      required to find the ones that it *does* have. There isn't even an
      establishing shot that would allow us to place it before or after the
      existence of the Friendship Castle. The visuals rule out winter, and
      suggest it's probably not summer, but that's it. The only hard upper
      bound is Flutter Brutter, in which a picture of Iron Will turns up.

      Spike comments that "we forgot to celebrate Arbor Day." We do not know
      when ponies could possibly have such a holiday, and this phrase is the
      only evidence of its existence. However, an "arbor day" is unambiguously
      a day when individuals are encouraged to plant a tree, which would only
      happen when planting a tree is a good idea. With earth pony magic, the
      time stretch for an arbor day could conceivably be extended, but
      Twilight is not an earth pony. This episode should not, therefore,
      happen earlier than the first spring of the series, and should be
      relatively early into it. Months later into a summer or an autumn, Spike
      would have forgotten about the Arbor Day himself.

      Twilight Sparkle's behavior is similar to that in [Lesson
      Zero,](#ep-2x03) so they could have been parts of the same chain of
      events.

      See also the commentary on [Mare Do Well](#ep-2x08) which could possibly
      be a timeline erased by the events of this episode.

      The dragons are migrating. While there could be other reasons for dragon
      migration, autumn sounds like a good one. However, we can't be sure of
      that, because it happens once per generation, anyway, and we don't even
      know *whose* generation.

      Spike finishes this episode by writing a letter to Princess
      Celestia. However, we cannot be certain that this happened as a result
      of the program established in [Lesson Zero,](#ep-2x03) because during
      the episode he also *receives* a personal letter from Princess Celestia,
      making this a soft, rather than hard constraint.

      The pegasi are sending fresh water to Cloudsdale, which should put it in
      early spring. However, it could in theory be autumn as well, in
      preparation for the snowfalls later in the year. We can only be sure
      that it wouldn't happen in winter, because the water collection method
      used would not be applicable. Summer is also possible, but quite unlikely.

      Fluttershy narrates a friendship report, describing the events as having
      happened today, which puts it after Lesson Zero.

      Rainbow Dash does not fangirl over Spitfire, making it more likely that
      this occurs after [Best Night Ever.](#ep-1x26)

      A baking contest is held, which usually occur in spring, but this
      episode is very self-contained and actually quite mobile.

      Pinkie narrates a friendship report, which would imply it happens after
      [Lesson Zero](#ep-2x03), but is not shown writing or sending or
      dictating, and while she narrates, *Celestia herself is on screen within
      five meters from her.* She finishes this speech with "How's that for a
      lesson, Princess Celestia?" spoken out of narration directly to
      Celestia, which Celestia ignores. I'm not entirely sure the letter
      actually existed.

      At this stage, Rarity has become better known as a designer, and the

      Rainbow Dash is capable of performing Sonic Rainboom on demand.

      In The Crystal Empire, the marriage is already fact.

      In the ending scenes, Rarity is dancing with Fancy Pants, which requires
      that Sweet and Elite, where she explicitly meets him for the first time,
      to happen prior.

      Twilight is reading more books than usual, a sign that she moved up in

      captain of the Wonderbolts, which can't happen before Read it and Weep,
      and is unlikely to happen before [Wonderbolts Academy,](#ep-3x07) since
      it represents a significant step up in ambition from wanting to *just*

      Timber wolves actually show up near populated areas, which they

      These two episodes occur simultaneously, so it's easier to treat them as

      We see the pets again. so this must be after the episodes they were
      introduced in, and we get a closer look at the baby phoenix that Spike
      got in Dragon Quest. We also see the Crystal Empire again, together with
      Cadance and Shining Armor, giving this episode a lot of redundant hard
      lower bounds.

      Since it is very unlikely that more than a few months have elapsed

      The time is explicitly immediately before the Summer Sun Celebration,
      though nobody specifies exactly which year it is. However, there is
      little doubt that it has to be the summer of the second year. While
      people often complain that it is highly unlikely that all the events of
      the first three seasons could fit into a single year, the [May The Best
      Pet Win](#ep-2x07) / [Tanks For The Memories](#ep-5x05) loop interlocks
      with the loop this episode makes with [Friendship is
      Magic](#ep-1x01-02), forcing no more than one summer to occur between
      the two episodes -- and it has to be whichever one this episode is in.

      You can, if you like, stretch the first three seasons to occupy two
      years instead of one, but since you can't stretch Season 4 to occupy
      more than six months, I don't really see why would you want
      to. Nevertheless, the seasonal lock against the autumn of the second
      year is a soft lock.

      Discord is reformed and nobody except Fluttershy trusts him at all.

      Since the Summer Sun Celebration is, obviously, a summer event, and
      Twilight is already a princess, the summer of the second year has to
      have started before that.

      The primary reason for the castle expedition is to find information on

      While Applejack says it's officially Apple Bucking Day, it's not certain
      whether it's the Applebuck Season. But the yellowing grass throughout
      the episode implies autumn. Due to Twilight having wings this can only
      be the second year's autumn or later, but since there's still
      considerable confusion about whether apples can be seen as season
      indicators in Equestria, this is a soft lock.

      If the *Journal of Friendship* is accepted as a canonical source, there
      was a Journal record for this episode that immediately follows [Power
      Ponies](#ep-4x06).

      The episode is set during Fashion Week, putting it on an integer year
      boundary from [The Saddle Row Review](#ep-6x09). Since in The Saddle Row
      Review, Rarity's statement fixes the season of that episode to autumn,
      this one also has to be an autumn episode. Like the Saddle Row Review
      itself, this episode cannot occur before the start of the second year's
      autumn.

      This is a Chest of Harmony Key incident and Rarity writes in the
      Journal.

      While this is not a Chest incident, the Apples and Pinkie argue about

      It's Rainbow Dash's birthiversary. This is a Chest of Harmony Key
      incident, but Pinkie is not actually shown writing in the
      Journal. Because of this, and Twilight's wings, it implies that Rainbow
      had at least one birthday incident not shown on screen.

      Incidentally, a photo of Pinkie's cutie mark party includes Maud, and
      makes it her first on-screen appearance, though not the introduction to

      This one is very independent and difficult to position. It is taking
      place immediately prior and during the Ponyville Days festival, which
      sounds like it should be a yearly thing, but is never referred to again.

      Rarity narrates at the end, and it sounds like she's narrating a Journal

      This episode does not feature Twilight or Spike, which makes it possible
      to backdate it far away in the past. It must occur after Call of the
      Cutie, because the CMC are together, and possibly after or not far
      before the Show Stoppers, because they are capable of joint planning.

      It should also appear after Lesson Zero, because Smartypants the doll
      can be observed, hidden under Apple Bloom's bed -- visual gag or no, it
      can end up there.

      It certainly looks like Applejack is more immature and overprotective
      than she usually is around the timeframe of season 4, and it has been
      argued that this, as well as Lesson Zero itself, are results of recent
      exposure to Discord's magic, in which case this episode immediately
      follows Lesson Zero.

      The Cutie Map is introduced. It is highly unlikely the Mane 6 took more
      than a day or two after its appearance to sit in their thrones,
      whereupon the Map appears, which means that Twilight's Kingdom has to
      immediately precede this episode.

      This is also one of the two episodes with no roots in the throne room
      that appear as the result of Castle Sweet Castle -- the other one, where

      As a result of this episode, the look of the throne room changes to
      include the roots of the Golden Oak Library, requiring all subsequent
      episodes that have scenes set there and show the roots to happen
      afterwards.

      We do need to allow some time to permit Twilight to accumulate the
      castle anxiety, so an episode may get squeezed between this and The
      Cutie Map. Applejack is planting trees, which in most worlds, you would
      want to do in spring, but we can't really be sure with earth pony magic.

      The whole episode is based on Rainbow Dash delaying the approach of
      winter and causing it to occur explosively, so it's right on that
      transition line between the two. I'm marking it as the last episode of
      autumn rather than the first episode of winter, though, because every
      winter episode of that year has to follow.

      It is important that this is explicitly the first time Rainbow observes
      Tank hibernating, so May The Best Pet Win may not occur more than about
      9 months prior. This episode has to follow [spring of the first
      year,](#ep-SM1-SP) which is the earliest time Rainbow could have
      acquired Tank when a wingless Twilight was present to see it, and is
      known to start in autumn -- so it's hard locked to follow the autumn of
      the second year.

      This episode is *probably* still located within year 2, which is why
      there's a soft lock against that winter. In any case, it will *have* to
      rubberband May The Best Pet Win after itself if it moves to year 3 or
      later.

      The opening establishing shot contains the Friendship Castle, and since
      Castle Sweet Castle has nothing comparable to the level of autumn
      observed on screen here, it also has to precede this.

      This episode avoids the appearance of Twilight, mentioning that she's a

      less any point after the formation of the CMC and before they get their
      marks. It obviously happens after Over a Barrel, though.

      Being Matilda and Cranky's wedding, this episode has to follow A Friend
      In Deed, but that is redundant, because it also contains Twilicorn. The
      final distance shot of Ponyville does contain the Friendship Castle. The
      only obvious upper bound is the CMC cutie marks.

      A lot of people would prefer if this episode never existed, but luckily

      The Grand Equestria Pony Summit is definitely not a regular event. There
      is little to date this episode, [Equestria Games](#ep-4x24) sounds like
      a good lower bound story-wise, but I'm not definite on that.

      Yakyakistan being out of contact until now should put this episode
      relatively early after the rediscovery of the Crystal Empire, but no
      earlier than Twilight's Kingdom, where Twilight laments she only gets to
      smile and wave, and scenes in the throne room with roots prevent it from
      happening earlier than Castle Sweet Castle.

      Pinkie's incredible skill with filing is referenced in The One Where
      Pinkie Pie Knows. Cherry Jubilee appears and knows Pinkie, which adds
      The Last Roundup as a redundant lower bound. Wonderbolt Academy cadets
      appear in Pinkie's adventure as well, adding another redundant lower
      bound.

      Starlight Glimmer shows up spying on Twilight, limiting this to within
      the endcaps of season 5.

      Twilight complains of a week of nonstop princess duties which contained
      three unspecified events, which soft-sets this as immediately following
      either [Princess Spike,](#ep-5x10) [Party Pooped,](#ep-5x11) or both.

      Redundantly, it's pet grooming day, so pet introductory episodes must
      precede. Friendship Castle hard-limits it to start of season 5, and
      probably, but not necessarily, to after Castle Sweet Castle -- we never
      get to see the throne room.

      The hard upper bound is Starlight Glimmer becoming a live-in student,
      since she would never avoid participating in this adventure while being
      one.

      Starting in Rarity's Canterlot boutique places a hard lower bound on it,
      and so does Rainbow's membership in Wonderbolt Reserves. At the same
      time, most of the upper bound markers we have cannot be observed in
      Canterlot, but it obviously has to precede Rainbow Dash actually
      becoming a Wonderbolt in Newbie Dash.

      Rarity comments that "Ice irises are almost impossible to find in
      spring!" which fixes the season of this episode to spring. There is no
      way this can be the first year's spring, due to the Testing, Testing
      1-2-3 being a dependency of this episode and containing a winged
      Twilight, so it's at least the second year's.

      These two episodes are known to occur simutaneously, so they're best
      treated as a two-parter.

      Interestingly, Babs Seed appears in Made in Manehattan, but she is
      barely visible, and it's impossible to determine if she has a cutie mark
      or not.

      Coco Pommel introduces the plot in Made in Manehattan. Made in
      Manehattan is a Cutie Map mission and the throne room shows roots. The
      policepony seen in Manehattan is wearing a summer uniform, which would
      imply the season is probably summer, **but** [Sisterhooves
      Social](#ep-2x05) is a yearly event, and has to occur an integer number
      of years after the episode of the same name.

      Made in Manehattan is centered around Midsummer Theater Revival event,
      which would have to occur in summer -- unless the theater is called
      "Midsummer" for some stupid reason -- and if the pony calendar is
      anything like ours, it's the middle of it, i.e. June.

      School is in session. The CMC finally get their cutie marks, so every
      appearance of a Crusader with a mark must follow this episode. Notably,
      in some episodes aired later, the Crusaders don't feature, or their
      marks are not visible.

      Pip Squeak's campaign speech explicitly references the battle with
      Tirek. Diamond Tiara's speech references Discord. Apple Bloom's speech
      before the cutie mark epiphany implicitly references Appleoosa's Most
      Wanted.

      The plot of the episode implies that the elections of the Student Pony
      President coincide with a particular point in the yearly education
      cycle, more likely than not, start of the school year -- which is more
      likely to be the start of autumn, and there is no way it can be the
      first year's autumn. It can still happen in some other season, even
      though a disabled, rather than full, fountain in one of the shots
      corroborates the assertion that it's autumn.

      A pool/lake birthday party for Shady Daze implies summer, when playing
      in water is desirable. Cadance is pregnant with Flurry Heart, and yet
      it's not showing at all. The Cake Twins are approximately 20% smaller
      than they are in A Hearth's Warming Tail, are out of diapers, *(which
      would imply that [28 Pranks Later](#ep-6x15) didn't actually happen
      later...)* but are still using pacifiers.

      Flurry Heart being born sets an upper bound on this, and I'm not going
      to believe pony pregnancies taking *over* a year -- so there is a rubber
      band between this episode and the Crystalling, which can't be longer
      than 12 months and shouldn't be shorter than five or so.

      This Hearthwarming is set after Pinkie's discovery she might be related
      to Apples, after the introduction of Maud to Applejack, and features the
      Friendship Castle and Twilicorn.

      It is impossible for this Hearthwarming to be the same as the one
      depicted in [A Hearth's Warming Tail,](#ep-6x08) because the latter
      features all of the Mane Six together, and since no hide or hair of
      Starlight Glimmer can be seen, The Crystalling is an upper bound on it.
      However, it is not a hard bound. It *is* possible, in theory, for this
      episode and A Hearth's Warming Tail to occur in reverse order, or even,
      for Starlight Glimmer to somehow have skipped her first Hearth's Warming
      in the Friendship Castle. *(That episode is referred to as her first
      Hearth's Warming with the Mane 6.)*

      Winter of year 2 is a hard lower bound, since it's clear Twilight did
      not yet have wings during the winter of year 1.

      This is a Nightmare Night episode, which fixes its position in the

      Being a Nightmare Night episode, this episode cannot occur before the

      Quite a self-contained episode, but a shot with obvious hair of
      Starlight Glimmer hiding behind the bush forces it to stay within the
      bookends of Season 5.

      It coincides with a national holiday, resulting in a three day long
      weekend, but we don't know which ones ponies even have. [Make New
      Friends but Keep Discord](#ep-5x07) and [Twilight's
      Kingdom](#ep-4x25-26) are soft lower bounds, since in both, nobody
      except Fluttershy is on good enough terms with Discord to spend a
      weekend around him -- but they aren't hard lower bounds, because we can't
      really rule out this relationship swinging back and forth.

      This is a Cutie Map mission and the throne room has roots. Twilight is
      excited about the mission so much, that it's clear that both The Lost
      Treasure of Griffonstone and Made in Manehattan have already occurred
      and she's bored because she still didn't get a go. However, a case could

      While the CMC do not appear themselves, the incident of acquiring marks
      simultaneously is part of Twilight's lecture.

      Most of this episode happens entirely outside the primary timeline. The
      montage at the end is, apparently, spread over a substantial period of
      time.

      There is one important marker, but unfortunately we don't know when
      exactly does it change: Starlight's cottage in Our Town gets replaced by
      a tree at some point. The montage in the end of this episode still
      contains a cottage, rather than a tree.

      The parts of the movie that actually do happen in Equestria occur in
      Crystal Empire, and there's no sign of snow on the horizon, at least
      excluding winter for good. Twilight is already a princess, but this is
      her first "princess summit," and she explicitly isn't accustomed to her
      new wings yet.

      Cadance hasn't seen Twilight since her coronation, which requires this
      to happen prior to every other instance of Cadance meeting a winged
      Twilight, which gets progressively more redundant after Twilight's
      Kingdom.

      The events of the movie are condensed into at most five days.

      We have no clear information regarding the relative passage of time
      between the two worlds, but it's definitely not winter in Equestria,
      probably summer.

      Friendship Castle is in evidence, but we have no clear shot of the roots
      in the throne room, so we can't be certain if this happens after Castle
      Sweet Castle or before, but the Mane 6 are making a show of adjusting to
      their new throne room, so it has to be soonish after they first set hoof
      in it.

      We see very, very little of Equestria in this movie at all, but at the
      end Twilight appears and references the events of The Cutie Re-Mark
      about as explicitly as it was possible without being an outright
      spoiler, and mentions that they have just occurred. As such, it has to
      happen strictly between The Cutie Re-Mark and The Crystalling, because
      in the latter episode Twilight leaves for an extended trip to the
      Crystal Empire.

      No snow is visible in the portal to Ponyville, so it's not winter in
      Equestria.

      The Pony Movie With No Ponies In It.

      We can basically say nothing about the chronological position of this
      movie, except that it follows the previous one. While it is obviously
      summmer in Pedestria, we have no idea whether this matches Equestria,
      and even whether the time flows at the same rate on both sides of the

      Starlight Glimmer behaves like this is her first morning in Twilight's
      castle, or at least, the first week, which implies that the Cutie
      Re-Mark happened very recently, and the montage at the end of that
      episode covers future events. It is, at the very least, her first
      official friendship lesson.

      Flurry Heart is a newborn, at most a few days old, which implies a
      pregnancy period has to have elapsed since The One Where Pinkie Pie
      Knows.

      Crystal Empire clearly has winter, or very early spring, -- there is no
      evidence to suppose Crystal Empire is capable of the same total weather
      control as most of Equestria -- seeing as how it's about to freeze over
      the moment the Heart is broken. *(There are episodes where the snow is
      not observable around the Crystal Empire at all, so it definitely does
      have seasonal changes.)* Ponyville area, however, has green grass, which
      only leaves spring as the possible season.

      Tertiary canon *(Princess Cadance and the Spring Hearts Garden)* also
      claims Flurry Heart was born in winter or early spring.

      All of that cannot occur earlier than the start of the spring of the
      second year, because Twilight does not have wings during the entire
      first winter.

      This is a very floaty episode, most of which occurs in unexplored dragon

      exists. Pretty much nopony you would expect to see in there is
      present. The season in Ponyville is never clearly seen.

      [Princess Spike](#ep-5x10) is unlikely to happen after this episode,

      Starlight Glimmer is a friendship student for long enough not to bump

      redundant.

      Among other things, Rainbow Dash offers to introduce Starlight Glimmer
      to Spitfire, which is somewhat unlikely before [Newbie Dash](#ep-6x07),
      and probably has to happen a significant time afterwards. However, in
      Newbie Dash, Spitfire addresses Rainbow on friendly terms already, so
      this is a matter of argument.

      This episode introduces the Starlight/Trixie partnership, requiring all
      further episodes in which they interact to occur afterwards.

      Starlight feels more or less at home in the Friendship Castle, so a

      spring or summer of a year that includes events all the way to the [To
      Where and Back Again](#ep-6x25-26) and accompanying episodes, and at the
      time of writing, this would make this episode the chronologically latest
      one, with the possible exception of [Forever Filly](#ep-7x06). This is
      further supported by the observation that Starlight treats Twilight more
      like an equal than a teacher than in many subsequently aired episodes.

      The one snag for this interpretation is the absence of Trixie, but
      wouldn't she have family somewhere far away to pester on Hearth's
      Warming? Alternatively, she could be working doing special effects for
      the traditional play somewhere...

      It is impossible for this story to be the Hearth's Warming of year 1,
      since Twilight clearly did not have wings yet during that one. It is
      likewise impossible for this story to happen on Hearth's Warming of year
      2, unless Hearthbreakers happens in the winter of the year 3 somehow,
      which would be incredibly odd. This makes the winter of year 2 a hard
      lower bound and the winter of year 3 a soft one.

      The episode is set during Fashion Week, whenever that is, and therefore
      has to occur an integer amount of years after Rarity Takes Manehattan,
      and you would expect it to occur no more than a couple of months after
      The Gift of the Maud Pie. Coco Pommel shows up.

      This episode also explicitly states the season: According to Rarity,
      "tonight is the last night of the Fall season." Fashion's "fall season"
      need not explicitly fall on calendar season boundaries, but it pretty
      definitely has to be in autumn, and it has to be at least the second
      year's autumn.

      There are few of the usual markers in this one, even the Friendship

      Dash refers to "Wonderbolt practice," which hard marks this episode to

      The events depicted in this episode stretch across a substantial time
      period, but must follow Fluttershy saving Equestria at least twice,
      Twilight getting the Castle and putting up roots, and Rainbow Dash
      becoming a Wonderbolt.

      For the purposes of this chronology, we're referring to "the events of
      this episode" being the sequence when Zephyr Breeze returns to
      Ponyville, as we cannot reliably date the other sequences.

      Pinkie's wallet contains pictures of Moondancer, Cranky Doodle, Cheese
      Sandwich, and Iron Will, and she also mentions Mrs. Harshwhinny,
      requiring certain episodes to precede and producing the only known hard

      At no point we see clearly what season it is in Equestria, and most of
      the action happens indoors, or in barely defined jungle, where we don't
      know what the seasons look like.

      Twilight mentions Griffonstone, and Rainbow Dash never asks what it is,
      which means that it has to follow The Lost Treasure of
      Griffonstone. Twilight also mentions a "Friendship Summit" in there,
      which makes me think that at least some time has to have passed since
      Rainbow observed it as a hellhole, but we can't really tell how much.

      None of the other usual markers are present, and Rainbow Dash never even
      boasts she is a Wonderbolt despite endless occasions to do so, so this
      probably should be backdated before [Newbie Dash](#ep-6x07).

      Alternatively, it happens immediately after [Top Bolt](#ep-6x24),
      because for most of that episode, Rainbow is excited to catch up on
      Daring Do with Twilight.

      This episode is very ambiguously placed. School is in session, the
      fountain has water, but almost none of the usual markers are visible,
      Twilight, Spike and Starlight are missing entirely and the Friendship
      Castle does not appear. Rainbow Dash never once is referred to as a
      Wonderbolt.

      The banner from Rainbow Dash's birthiversary in Pinkie Pride makes an
      appearance, and the CMC sport their cutie marks. This probably needs to
      be backdated quite far into the past.

      The scene in the throne room places this after Castle Sweet Castle. The
      CMC have their cutie marks. The cake Rainbow purchases for a prank has
      to cost a lot and makes me think this should follow [Newbie
      Dash,](#ep-6x07) after which her income would have increased. At the
      same time, Rainbow's huge cloud mansion she lives alone in suggests she
      has always been a lady of means.

      Many of the pranks perpetrated by Rainbow require a teleport-capable
      unicorn to pull off, which suggests Starlight Glimmer was involved, and
      would imply this episode has to follow The Cutie Re-Mark -- but that
      would also contradict the appearance of the Cake Twins.

      The Cake twins are in diapers, which places this episode before Hearth's

      We have trouble with dating this episode seasonally, because it's set in
      the Crystal Empire.

      Spike explicitly mentions that this is the first trip to the Crystal
      Empire since The Crystalling, and at least a few months have passed
      since, because Twilight expects Flurry Heart to have grown.

      Only Spike, Twilight and Starlight are on this trip, making it possible

      Starlight Glimmer is completely absent. She would never avoid
      interacting with the events in the castle if she were present on the
      premises, and otherwise, she would probably come with the Mane
      6. However, she could, conceivably, be absent for some other reason.

      The events of Party Pooped are referred to.

      This episode would make more sense if it occurred before [What about

      This episode lacks almost all markers. Twilight, Spike, Rarity,
      Friendship Castle, the CMC never appear.

      The only hard constraint that I can identify so far is Over a Barrel,
      since Applejack mentions Braeburn to Rainbow, when we know Rainbow meets
      him for the first time in that episode, and wouldn't know who that is
      otherwise.

      [Griffon the Brush Off](#ep-1x05) is probably a *(likely redundant)*
      soft constraint, because prior to that Rainbow Dash does not seem to
      like Pinkie anywhere as much as here. For similar reasons, [Boast
      Busters](#ep-1x06) is also a soft constraint, since Snails displays
      mastery of telekinesis that would make Trixie far less impressive to him
      back then if he had it.

      Yes, this could fall through all the way to year 1.

      This is a Cutie Map mission, and while Starlight never turns up,

      Twilight says that Starlight did not tackle any friendship lessons since
      she met Trixie. That makes it impossible for any episode which contains
      a friendship lesson for Starlight to come between this episode and No
      Second Prances, as well as positions this episode after No Second
      Prances.

      While the typical markers for a student-Starlight time period
      are present, Rainbow Dash never refers to being a Wonderbolt.

      Very few markers except the Friendship Castle itself, no observable

      Apple Bloom has her cutie mark, positioning this episode after Crusaders
      of the Lost Mark, and the present-time sequences occur after that year's
      Zap Apple season, locking it into an annual relationship with Family

      Starlight Glimmer is in attendance, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt and has
      been one for an extended period, judging by ready recognition.

      This is a Cutie Map mission, which requires this to happen after Spice
      Up Your Life, when Twilight and Starlight fixed the map.

      Rainbow Dash is looking forward to catching up on Daring Do with
      Twilight, which suggests this episode occurs immediately before
      [Stranger Than Fan Fiction,](#ep-6x13) but this is not a hard boundary,
      because there's an unspecified "Wonderbolt emergency" at the end of the
      episode, which may or may not prevent this. Unless it was, in fact, a
      prank, which it could be.

      Rainbow Dash has just completed "spring training," which fixes the
      season to spring or summer. Since we have a fixed season, indirectly
      this produces a hard lower bound against spring of year 2, which is
      probably redundant.

      Starlight is friends with Trixie already, which places this after No
      Second Prances, and it features Thorax, which places it after The Times
      they are a Changeling.

      There is no clear indication just what season a "Sunset Festival" would
      happen in, but autumn seems more likely. However, this is the only case
      when the trees around Starlight's village have blooms on them, which
      would suggest spring instead.

      Incidentally, the tactically easiest way to kidnap Cadance, Shining
      Armor and Flurry Heart is not to do this *in* the Crystal Empire, but
      rather, when they're traveling back home from their visit to Twilight
      that occurs in [A Flurry of Emotions](#ep-7x03) -- which is why I'm
      placing it immediately prior: A Flurry of Emotions can occur *during*
      the time Starlight and Trixie travel on hoof to Starlight's village and
      travel back, which would explain Starlight's absence during that episode
      rather well, and make the overwhelmingly successful kidnapping of every
      princess in Equestria by Chrysalis a little less dubious.

      If that theory is correct, though, the Mane 5 are getting kidnapped
      while Twilight is playing with Flurry Heart...

      Starlight's cottage in Our Town has been torn down and replaced by a
      tree at some point, so there's a redundant hard lock against The Cutie
      Re-Mark.

      This episode unambiguously follows To Where and Back Again very closely,

      Being an episode centered on Flurry Heart interacting with Twilight,
      this episode has to follow The Crystalling, where Twilight saw her for
      the first time.

      Friendship Castle, Flurry Heart are in evidence, but Starlight
      isn't. Trixie and Sunburst are not present either, even though normally,
      Sunburst would be the prime candidate for this job if Shining Armor and
      Cadance wanted some time off. Their reason they give for presence in
      Ponyville sounds rather dubious, given the lack of interest in modern
      art they demonstrate. [To Where and Back Again](#ep-6x25-26) is *not* a
      hard bound on this episode, either below or above. Where it is placed in
      the timeline depends primarily on its temporal relationship to the
      birthday of Flurry Heart, and other episodes will have to happen around
      it.

      By my estimates, based on observed level of development, Flurry Heart
      has to be between 6 and 9 months old at this point. Twilight has
      accumulated at least 15 different pre-packaged gifts for Flurry, which,
      depending on the rate she accumulated them, would imply she hasn't had a
      chance to bestow them on Flurry for at least a few months. At the same
      time, multiple extended instances of spending time together had to occur
      in the past for Flurry to get so attached to Twilight.

      School is in session, because the sick foals got sick on a school
      picture day, and I suspect this implies that this is autumn, probably
      early autumn.

      Friendship Castle and student-Starlight are in evidence.

      This is explicitly Maud's first visit to Ponyville since the moment
      Friendship Castle grew, and establishes that she did not visit the town
      at least since before [Twilight's Kingdom](#ep-4x25-26). This indirectly
      establishes a redundant upper bound on [Maud Pie](#ep-4x18).

      The cave first seen in Gauntlet of Fire makes an appearance and suffers
      significant remodeling, requiring this episode to occur afterwards.

      Rarity mentions working on an order for Countess Coloratura, requiring
      this episode to occur after their introduction to each other.

      This can't happen before The Gift of the Maud Pie, since Maud does not
      yet have her rocktorate there.

      Trixie was explicitly the first friend Starlight made beside the Mane 6,
      so this can't happen earlier than No Second Prances *and* Every Little
      Thing She Does, because it undeniably contains a friendship lesson, and
      no friendship lesson for Starlight can occur between these two
      episodes. In addition, Starlight and Pinkie's reaction to the line "It's
      not like she enslaved anypony lately" suggests that Every Little Thing
      She Does actually happened very recently.

      There are no mentions of Starlight saving the day whatsoever, so we
      can't position this episode around [To Where and Back
      Again](#ep-6x25-26) with any certainty.

      Market selling canned preserves makes it unlikely for this episode to
      happen in spring.

      This is a landmark episode: Maud completes her rocktorate and moves to
      the cave near Ponyville, requiring any episode that features her as a
      denizen of Ponyville to follow. We don't know yet if any will follow,
      but some might.

      This is one of those disconnected episodes.

      Friendship Castle does not appear on screen, but Starlight does, setting

      Sassy Saddles' statement that they're having a winter to spring
      transition in terms of fashion lines fixes the season of this episode to
      spring. Despite some apples being present in the trees around the CMC
      clubhouse, that's what it has to be, and probably, it has to be very
      early in that spring. This cannot be the spring of year 1, but it still
      can be the spring of year 2.

      Rarity cannot remember when was the last time she hung out with Sweetie
      Belle, which means that at least The Cart Before The Ponies has to be
      rather far away in the past.

      This episode references numerous other episodes of Season 6 primarily by
      means of a wall of photos, serving as an upper bound for them.

      Rarity mentions she runs three shops, placing it after the opening of
      her Manehattan boutique.

      Rarity orders her stones rather than digs for them herself, and it's
      possible to make a case this episode has to follow Rock Solid
      Friendship.

      Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, so Newbie Dash has come and gone. Numerous

      are referred to, but since they are all also prerequisites for Newbie

      trainee uniforms, requiring this episode to follow Top Bolt.

      Most of the episode happens in Our Town and most of the usual major
      markers are not visible. The blooms in trees and bushes suggest spring,
      but the season is not defined clearly in spoken lines.

      There is a hard lock against The Cutie Re-Mark, because, even though
      Starlight is neither present nor is conclusively referred to as a
      friend, her cottage in Our Town has already been torn down.

      The dialogue between Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo regarding the words
      "when I was younger" may be interpreted as a reference to the events of
      Forever Filly, but is far too ambiguous to be a solid hard lock. It is
      also somewhat unlikely that the picture of Big Mac and Cherilee together
      would still hang in the CMC Clubhouse as seen in Forever Filly after the
      events of this episode.

      Big Mac and Sugar Belle are established as special someponies, which
      should become a solid marker, but probably won't.

      Apple Bloom has her cutie mark, however, we don't see Twilicorn or
      Starlight or the Friendship Castle. We do see Photo Finish and Hoity
      Toity again, but the presence of Apple Bloom's mark makes marking their
      episodes redundant.

      Pinkie Pie mentions Sassy Saddles as a potential contest judge, which
      requires Canterlot Boutique to exist.

      Spike mentions Coloratura as a potential contest judge, which he
      wouldn't do unless Rarity was already acquainted with her, which
      requires The Mane Attraction to have happened.

      Hoity Toity refers to "Miss Pommel's debut in Manehattan last week."
      This could have happened both before and after the opening of Rarity's
      Manehattan boutique, but is more likely to have happened after.

      This episode is all about student-era Starlight, and thus has to happen
      after she became one. This is also a Cutie Map mission, so it must
      happen after the map was repaired.

      There are, however, no clear hard markers that would allow to date it
      beyond that, as Starlight never refers to Trixie or Maud, nor anything
      else that could have placed it more precisely, and my hunch is that it
      should go *before* [To Where and Back Again](#ep-6x25-26) rather than
      after.

      Since this episode features the yaks, it must occur after Party Pooped,
      when they reopened the borders.

      Starlight is not in evidence, permitting this episode to be backdated
      rather far away.

      It's not winter in Ponyville, and Applejack is picking apples, but later
      on, Rutherford says that yaks will wait until spring. Which implies that
      it has to be either summer or autumn, not that it helps much. We don't
      know what season Yaksurbertfest would happen in, and while the
      association with Oktoberfest might imply autumn, such associations can
      be deceptive.

      The premise of the episode -- attending a traditional yak holiday to
      improve the understanding of the yak culture -- and the solution to the
      problem that Pinkie elects to use makes a lot more sense *(or any
      sense)* if it precedes the goodwill tour to Yakyakistan that occurs
      during [Dungeons and Discords,](#ep-6x17) or at least happens more or
      less during the same timeframe.

      This episode is highly chronologically disconnected. None of the usual
      markers appear, and it can conceivably occur at any time after [Keep
      Calm and Flutter On](#ep-3x10). However, for character development
      progression reasons, it probably occurs after [Make New Friends But Keep
      Discord,](#ep-5x07).

      In one of the frames, Discord passes by the spa building, which, at the
      time, is located in central Ponyville. This is not where it is found
      during [No Second Prances](#ep-6x06). We do not know when did it move,
      but if it did, and the spa doesn't just have a second location in town,
      this also has to precede that episode.

      This episode is highly chronologically disconnected, and mostly consists
      of flashbacks. However, it makes the more sense the earlier it happens,
      as the further it is in the future, the more silly the whole mystery of
      the Apple Parents becomes. The only hard lower bound on this episode so
      far identified is Apple Bloom's cutie mark.

      This episode introduces Grand Pear, however, it is unlikely he will be a
      recurring character. Nevertheless, any episodes in which he is mentioned
      will have to occur afterwards.
